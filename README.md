# Golang Lambda Deploy Action

This action will provide a deploy interface to your Golang AWS lambda code. It checks if the labda function (`FUNCTION_NAME`) currently exists, if so, it will update it, if not, it will create it.

You can edit the workflow file to add more configuration flags to your lambda, such as VPC, subnets, etc.

## Secrets
These are the AWS Secret Key, Key ID and role, which must be added as a **repository secret**.

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_ROLE` (the arn string representing the role that will be given to your lambda)

## Environment Variables
 - `AWS_REGION`: your-aws-region, default: us-east-1
 - `ENTRY_FILE`: your-go-entry-file, default: main.go
 - `FUNCTION_NAME`: your-lambda-function-name, default: the repository name

The entry file should be the one containing your `lambda.Start()` call.
